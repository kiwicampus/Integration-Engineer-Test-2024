## **Kiwibot**

[**Kiwibot**](https://www.kiwibot.com/) links on-demand customers with you. We move atoms from point A to B safely, efficiently, and affordably. We're improving people's lives with the world's most affordable and technologically advanced delivery service for local commerce worldwide. Since our start  in 2017, *Kiwibot* has made over 90,000 deliveries and built over 800 robots. This has allowed us to be the number one robot delivery platform on earth. 

Since its early stages **Kiwibot** has shown amazing ideas, strategies, and developments to propose a new way to perform last-mile delivery. All of that was embodied in a single box, our first version. However, over the years, different versions have significantly improved our logistics, operations, design, and especially software, using not only pure robotics but also artificial intelligence. At this stage, we are ready to perform astonishing new developments for our industry as a world-leading company in the last mile delivery with new versions of robots.

# **Project Description**
This project is a simply dev-container to read previous recorded `ros2 bag` and perform actions over the published topics. You'll get some `ros2 bag` and the code-bone of some nodes that you'll complete in order to achieve some specific task. This project is to validate the knowledge of new candidates which are applying for a roll in the AI&Robotics team, we'll evaluate concepts and basics of ROS2, docker, Python, C++, Git, LinuxOS, programming order and style, among others.

## **Installation & Requirements**
A recommendation is to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the main IDE for development. Make sure you also have installed in your host:
 1. [docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
 2. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
 3. [Remote development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extensions for VSCode
 4. [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/)(Jammy)[recommended]. In case you use another Linux based OS, the support by our side could be not enough to proper configure your dev-environment.
<br />

## **Project description and details:**
Please read the next documents order to complete the project:

1. Instructions for running the stack: [running_dev_container](docs/running_dev_container.md)

2. Rules of the project: [test_project_description](docs/project_rules.md)
